        <p>For your astronomy class, you will be practicing your identification of important constellations. For this assessment, you will pick a card to reveal it. The card will either contain the image of a consetellation, or the name of it. You will then pick another card. If the constellations are a match, you will win points. If not, your revealed cards will be flipped over again. Good luck!</p>
