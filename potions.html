        <h1>Welcome to Potions Class!</h1>
        <p>For your potions class, you will be practicing mixing ingredients to create different potions. For this test, you will be identifying the three ingredients that go into the potion. You will be given a multiple choice list, and you will pick one ingredient from each list. The description of your potion will be given to you once the potion is mixed. If it is not correct, you can keep trying until you make the correct concoction. Good luck!</p>

        <!--Still needs to be done with other technologies:
        
        - Randomly generate a prompt for which potion needs to be made
        - Validate the input to see if the potion is correct or not
        - Let the player try again
        - Keep track of the number of tries to produce a score
